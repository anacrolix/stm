// An implementation of the "Santa Claus problem" as defined in 'Beautiful
// concurrency', found here: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/stm/beautiful.pdf
//
// The problem is given as:
//
//   Santa repeatedly sleeps until wakened by either all of his nine reindeer,
//   back from their holidays, or by a group of three of his ten elves. If
//   awakened by the reindeer, he harnesses each of them to his sleigh,
//   delivers toys with them and finally unharnesses them (allowing them to
//   go off on holiday). If awakened by a group of elves, he shows each of the
//   group into his study, consults with them on toy R&D and finally shows
//   them each out (allowing them to go back to work). Santa should give
//   priority to the reindeer in the case that there is both a group of elves
//   and a group of reindeer waiting.
//
// Here we follow the solution given in the paper, described as such:
//
//   Santa makes one "Group" for the elves and one for the reindeer. Each elf
//   (or reindeer) tries to join its Group. If it succeeds, it gets two
//   "Gates" in return. The first Gate allows Santa to control when the elf
//   can enter the study, and also lets Santa know when they are all inside.
//   Similarly, the second Gate controls the elves leaving the study. Santa,
//   for his part, waits for either of his two Groups to be ready, and then
//   uses that Group's Gates to marshal his helpers (elves or reindeer)
//   through their task. Thus the helpers spend their lives in an infinite
//   loop: try to join a group, move through the gates under Santa's control,
//   and then delay for a random interval before trying to join a group again.
//
// See the paper for more details regarding the solution's implementation.
